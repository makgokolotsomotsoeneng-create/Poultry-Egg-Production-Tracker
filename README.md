# Poultry-Egg-Production-Tracker
Python App to track daily egg collection.

- It calculates total eggs, average daily eggs, and eggs per hen.
- Alerts when production drops below 80% of average.
- Generates a line chart of egg production over time

Enter the number of days to record, (I used 5 days).
Input the date, number of eggs collected, and number of hens for each day.
View summary statistics and production alerts in the console.
Check the generated line chart, (matplotlib should be installed to avoid errors).
